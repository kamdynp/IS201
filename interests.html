    <h1 id="Top">Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)</h1>
    <p class="et">POTS is renowned for inducing dizziness upon standing, with some individuals experiencing actual fainting spells when attempting to rise, hence earning POTS the nickname "the fainting disease".</p>
    <p>Roughly 65% of women diagnosed with POTS fall into the high-risk category for suicide and 18% claim they have already made an attempt. As someone who suffers from POTS on a daily basis, I can attest that the lack of research on POTS is infuriating and discouraging. In July 2020, I received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Shortly after, I faced a myriad of symptoms including extreme weakness and fatigue, tachycardia, chronic headaches, and passing out multiple times a day. After suffering from symptoms for over a year and six months of brutal testing, I was diagnosed with POTS, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Hypothyroidism, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in January 2022. Since then, my life has completely flipped upside down. I had to quit volleyball, the sport I dedicated years of my life to, I could not attend school because my symptoms were so difficult to manage, and I struggled with mental health challenges, something I had never dealt with before. It is my hope that after reading this website, the reader gets a firm grasp on POTS and how many lives it affects each and every day. </p>

    <h2>Facts</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system.</li>
      <li>It is a chronic and frequently severely debilitating condition that typically affects females, primarily adolescents going through puberty.</li>
      <li>Since the symptoms can be very easily confused with extreme exhaustion, the number of lives affected by POTS is unknown.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is estimated that POTS affects roughly 1 to 3 million Americans alone and at least 1 million more after COVID-19.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>There are multiple types of POTS and depending on the person, the symptoms could vary.</li>
      <li>The 4 types of POTS are:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Neuropathic POTS- Neuropathic POTS deals with damage to the small fiber nerves that regulate blood constriction in the limbs and stomach.</li>
        <li>Hyperadrenergic POTS- Hyperadrenergic POTS is associated with elevated levels of norepinephrine, a stress hormone.</li>
        <li>Hypovolemic POTS- Hypovolemic POTS describes POTS with alarmingly low levels of blood (hypovolemia).</li>
        <li>Secondary POTS- Secondary POTS involves another condition that typically causes autonomic neuropathy. These other conditions include Lyme disease, lupus, or Sj√∂gren's syndrome.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>To be diagnosed you have to go through extensive testing. Some tests include:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Tilt Table Test</li>
        <li>Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART)</li>
        <li>Echocardiograms</li>
        <li>Electrocardiograms</li>
        <li>Cardiac Stress Tests</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
